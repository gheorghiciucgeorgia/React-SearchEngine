##Using the API:Search from the MediaWiki

To perform an aadvanced seach for wiki pages by title or context text, I used the HTTP GET request Method. The GET method is applied from a particular source, it is used to get specific variables derived from a group. 

In this code I used the React Class Component to track state and lifecycle on a React component.

The component "App" includes the "extends React.Component" statement, in this statement it inheritancing to the React.Component and it gives our component acces to the Reac.Component's functions. The component also uses the "render()" methos so that it can return HTML.

The "contructor()" function in the "App" component is called so that it gets initiated. The props are passed to the constructor. Including the "super()" statement executes the parent constructor function in this case the "React.Component". In the "state" object is where we store the values beloging to the component in this case the wikiSearchReturnValuesand the wikiSearchTerms.
